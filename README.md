# Space-Shooter
<h3>Motivation behind the project:</h3>
<i>
  It is a personal project that I started in order to learn the basics of game development.
  It started off as a Cannon-Shooting game and somehow ended up as Space-Shooting game.
  The change was due to the fact that I was looking for a background image for my game and stumbled upon this space-background-image that looked kind of eye catching
  to me at that moment. I used it as my bg-image and made it rotate so the cannon would like it flaoted in the space. To my surpise, it looked perfect. The only problem
  now was that I had a cannon floating in the space which did not make any sense. Consequently, I had to change the game completely.

  <h3>Note:</h3>
  I'm aware that the code is not very well moduled, mostly on the account of it being a test project. I wanted to try out new things and not worry about the organization
  of my code.
